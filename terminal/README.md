# Terminal
Terminal allows you to log into seperate accounts and access seperate files and use around seven different console commands.

This is a sample of what interacting with the terminal could look like:

### Change `dir.txt` Contents
Remember to change the `dir.txt` file to contain the path on your device that the python script (`terminal.py`) is located in (not including the `terminal.py` part).  
Ex:  
```
C:/Users/test/Documents/Github/Code/terminal
```  
if your `terminal.py` file is located in `'C:/Users/test/Documents/Github/Code/terminal'`.  
  
You can get the directory easily by downloading the `Code` repository, going into the `terminal` folder, clicking on the title bar and copying the path at the top. Then paste it into the `dir.txt` file

Make sure you replace all backslashes ( \ ) with forward slashes ( / ).
  
### The program **_WILL NOT_** work properly without the `dir.txt` file being set properly.
(Also it will not run the program without the dir.txt being changed from the default.)
