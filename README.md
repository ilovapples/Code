# Code
Some of the code I've made.


This is not a project at all, it's just a code dump for some stuff I made that I guess amateur programmers or others might like? 
I really don't know, but it's kind of just a spot for me to put my code so I can access it elsewhere without having to migrate the files.
Check it out if you want.
